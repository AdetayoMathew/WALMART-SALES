## Analysis List
1. **Product Analysis**: Conduct analysis on the data to understand the different product lines, the product lines performing best, and the product lines that need improvement.
2. **Sales Analysis**: Analyze sales trends of products to measure the effectiveness of sales strategies and identify necessary modifications for increased sales.
3. **Customer Analysis**: Uncover different customer segments, purchase trends, and the profitability of each customer segment.

## Approach Used
- **Data Wrangling**: Inspect data to ensure NULL values and missing values are detected and replaced.
- **Build a Database**: Create tables and insert the data. Select columns with null values and handle them accordingly.
- **Feature Engineering**: Generate new columns from existing ones to provide additional insights into sales data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze data to answer specific questions and address project aims.

## Revenue And Profit Calculations
- $ COGS = unitPrice * quantity $
- $ VAT = 5% * COGS $
- Total (gross_sales) = VAT + COGS
- Gross Profit (grossIncome) = Total (gross_sales) - COGS
- Gross Margin = Gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue

Example with the first row in our DB:
Data given:
- Unit Price = 45.79
- Quantity = 7
- COGS = 45.79 * 7 = 320.53
- VAT = 5% * COGS = 5% 320.53 = 16.0265
- Total = VAT + COGS = 16.0265 + 320.53
- Gross Margin Percentage = Gross Income / Total Revenue = 16.0265 / 336.5565 â‰ˆ 0.047619 (approximately 4.7619%)
